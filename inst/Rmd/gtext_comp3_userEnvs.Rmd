### **Module:** ***User-specified Environmental Data***

**BACKGROUND**

Users may want to use environmental data that they have compiled themselves for use in the *Wallace* analysis.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Users may upload one or more raster files, which must be in single-file format (e.g. .tif, .asc) and not multi-file (e.g. .grd + .gri, .bil + .hdr). Additionally, all rasters must have the same extent and resolution (cell size).
