# wallace 0.6.2
- Turned off evaluation of code chunks in userReport.Rmd. Now the building of user session code is much, much faster.
- Made code compatible with `leaflet` version 1.0.1. There was a mysterious problem with zooming to points before clearing markers and/or plotting points, which resulted in crashing as soon as points are plotted unless the user had the Github master version of `leaflet` installed. Thus the code was rearranged and cleaned to accomodate the current `leaflet` version on CRAN. 
- Fixed some errors in userReport.Rmd relating to the user .csv path and printing of a couple of headings.
